        <h1 id="title">A Search for Dark Matter utilizing Artificial Intelligence and a High-Frequency Cavity</h1>
        <p>
            Dark Matter is one of modern physics's most mysterious problems and thousands of scientists are actively working on this issue. It is necessary to keep in mind that it surrounds us and constitutes 80% of the total mass of the universe, but nevertheless, we know almost nothing about it. Our goal is to go on a search for Dark Matter at parameters that nobody has ever searched before. Our research project is based on the results of theoretical physics, which predicts the existence of Dark Matter. In addition, we will investigate the applicability of artificial intelligence to optimize the design of our experiment and the simulations needed. Two of the most promising Dark Matter candidates are the axion and the dark photon, which are also frequently reported in the scientific media. These can be found through coupling with specific electromagnetic modes within a cavity.

        <h3>Realizing the experiment</h3>
        <p>
            Developing such a cavity resonator, which allows for storing electromagnetic waves at specific resonant frequencies, is one of the main aspects of our research project. The production of the cavity will be realized at the mechanical workshop of the Physics department. To detect possible signals of the dark matter particles we are designing a complex receiver chain that allows the signal to be converted into digital information for usage on a computer. The experimental setup needs to be calibrated. For this purpose, an artificial signal is generated and analyzed. This allows the behavior of the electromagnetic field in the resonator as well as the modes to be investigated. For the axion search the calibrated RF cavity will be installed inside a high 14 Tesla magnetic field, provided by the Excellence cluster “Quantum Universe". We will do multiple measurements, each one of which could take up to a few weeks, and will be conducted at a frequency range of around 4 GHz, with some variance induced through tuning methods. We expect to be able to detect signals above a minimal sensitivity of gaγ > 3.5 ·10−11 GeV−1.

        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
            During the measurements, we find out if we detected a particle or are able to exclude the existence of one in the particle mass range scanned by us, which would be a great scientific success either way since we would be the first to scan this area. In addition, we can test the applicability of artificial intelligence to simulate our cavity. In the framework of our project, a small cooperation with the Max Planck Institute in Munich could take place, to use their receiver chain for our experiment. Moreover, this research project itself is a collaboration of Professor Hillert’s and Professor Garutti’s research groups, which are also providing us with equipment and helpful suggestions.
